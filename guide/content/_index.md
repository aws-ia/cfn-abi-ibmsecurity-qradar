# IBM Security QRadar AWS Built-in

The purpose of this document is to walk you through the process of utilizing the AWS Built-in program (ABI) program along with QRadar Log Insights or QRadar SIEM (Cloud-NAtive SaaS) to easily setup and configure both CloudTrail and GuardDuty (optionally) in your AWS multi-account structure using AWS Control Tower or AWS Organizations and easily configure the ingestion of that data into QRadar.

The AWS Built-in program is a differentiation program that validates Partner solutions which have automated their solution integrations with relevant AWS foundational services like identity, management, security and operations.  This program helps customers find and deploy a validated Partner solution that addresses specific customer use cases while providing deep visibility and control of AWS native service integration.
